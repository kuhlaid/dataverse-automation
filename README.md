# Purpose of this project

Patrick Gale has designed software integration processes over the past two decades at the University of North Carolina. Most recently Patrick has focused his efforts on assessing the Dataverse API. These assessments have led to the development of various frameworks to help users overcome the technical barriers and pitfalls when using the API to curate their data. It is Patrick's goal to see an increased use of the API through demonstrating that automation can improve the quality and consistency of data curation.
