# The purpose

:::info[Purpose]
Patrick Gale has designed software integration processes for over two decades at the University of North Carolina. Patrick's work with assessing the Dataverse Project API have led to the development of various frameworks to help users overcome the technical barriers and pitfalls when using the API to curate their data. It is Patrick's goal to see an increased use of the API through demonstrating that automation can improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of data curation. This guide provides automation tools and methods to simplify the use of the Dataverse API.

## Getting started

### Working with the Dataverse automation tools

A good starting point for working with Dataverse automation is to visit the `dv-api-test` repository on GitHub at https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started. There you will find a link to launch Binder (an online service for testing Jupyter Notebooks). Binder will load the automation code from `dv-api-test` within your web browser. As you become more comfortable with the automation tools and Jupyter Notebooks, you can try setting up a Jupyter environment on your computer to simplify the curation of your data to the Dataverse.

To simply become more familiar with using Jupyter Notebooks, you can also visit https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/. This website is a quick and easy way to write and test Jupyter Notebooks.

My personal preference, but requires a few extra steps, and the instructions can be found at https://github.com/kuhlaid/dv-api-test?tab=readme-ov-file#preferred-jupyterlab-set-up.

### Additional data curation resources
